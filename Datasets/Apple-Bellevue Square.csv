8/19/2025,Prashant Chahar,1,Super rude staff. Not helpful at all. Doesn't want to work with the customer.
8/19/2025,Billy Allocca,1,"This store has really gone downhill in terms of service and quality, just had a really bad experience that is not typical of Apple with highly confused employees, my pickup order not being available in the window I selected, confusingly being bumped around to multiple staff trying to figure out a simple exchange, and the store wasn’t even that busy on a Wednesday night. Really disappointing to see Apple’s standard of quality slip so much. Would recommend reconsidering Apple products at this point, and maybe just sticking to online."
8/15/2025,Yuetong Lu,1,"I have visited the Bellevue Square Apple Store many times and previously had good experiences here — for example, they replaced my broken camera under AppleCare+ at no cost. I also had my screen replaced under AppleCare+ at another Apple Store in New York without any issues.Today, I came in just to have my screen cleaned. The Genius Bar manager pointed out a “crack” on my trackpad, which I had never noticed. I asked if AppleCare+ covers accidental damage — the first staff member said yes, and even said this issue counted as accidental damage. But when another staff member took over, they said it did not count, called it “cosmetic damage,” and told me, “I told you, if you want to repair today, $99.”If AppleCare+ only covers functional damage, then what’s the point of paying for it? The warranty would be enough. The contradictory answers and dismissive attitude made this a very disappointing experience at a store I used to trust."

8/15/2025,Matt Beecroft,1,"Went in to get my screen repaired because face ID stopped working spontaneously.  They described it as simple fix. It took significantly longer than what they said, and they wiped the entire phone. I now have to go to the AT&T store and get the new phone activated and spend the rest of my evening restoring my phone. iCloud backup only does so much and most of the TPA apps require reactivation so simple repair here just cost me half a day or more. I do need a phone -as many people do - for work so this was really disruptive.I wish Apple had more accountability, but they are big enough that they really don't have to care and they don't"
8/15/2025,Jason L,5,"Stopped by the Apple Store at Bellevue Square Mall. It’s on the second floor near Nordstrom, with general mall parking and shared restrooms. There is none inside the store. The store layout is intuitive, and everything is well organized. I came to check out the cameras on the latest iPhones. There are lots of working demo units available. The staff were helpful and approachable without being pushy when I was checking the cameras on the phone. It’s the consistent Apple experience, which is clean, efficient, and customer-focused.Efficient: YesFirst-Time Friendliness: YesWould I Return: YesJY review"

8/15/2025,MARY,3,"My sister and I came to replace her iPhone through the upgrade program. During the migration process, we encountered several issues and ended up being stuck there for hours—we weren’t able to take the phone home or even to cancel, and time was running out. It was so frustrating, especially since no one seemed to have a solution or the willingness to genuinely help. My sister nearly lost important data for her work in the process. Thankfully, Alex stepped in. He was friendly, kind, knowledgeable, and truly went above and beyond to assist us. He even negotiated with his manager on our behalf. He’s the best!"

8/15/2025,Nayef Yassin,1,Had me wait for an hour at a Genius Bar appointment only to tell us after that the device is too old to be serviced anymore (which is completely understandable had they called it out during the reservation making process or even before the in-store hour long wait)

7/15/2025,Andrea S,5,"Mein iPhone Display hatte leider einen Sprung und ich hatte online einen Termin für nachmittags vereinbaren können. Da ich nicht sicher war, wie lange die Reparatur dauern wird, bin ich bereits vormittags in den Apple Store und konnte es sogar sofort abgeben und es wurde innerhalb von 3 Stunden repariert. Natürlich sind 329 $ + Tax viel Geld, jedoch kostet diese Reparatur in Deutschland 405 Euro."

7/15/2025,Karthik Kokku,5,"The Apple Store at Bellevue Square sets the gold standard for customer service, efficiency, and in-store experience. Whether you're in for a quick pickup or a Genius Bar appointment, the experience is consistently smooth, well-orchestrated, and elevated.I recently visited for support with my iPhone and was immediately greeted by a team member who checked me in with precision and professionalism. Despite how busy the store was, everything moved like clockwork. The Genius Bar team was outstanding—knowledgeable, patient, and genuinely interested in solving the issue rather than rushing through it.The store itself is beautifully laid out: clean, bright, and interactive, with plenty of staff available to answer questions, demo products, or walk you through upgrades. I also appreciated how seamlessly they handled a trade-in and new purchase, making the entire process frictionless and fast.This location reflects everything you'd expect from the Apple brand—cutting-edge technology backed by thoughtful, human-centered service. Whether you're a long-time Apple user or exploring your first device, the Bellevue Square team will take great care of you.Highly recommend without hesitation."
6/15/2025,Alex D,1,No one is willing to help you
6/15/2025,Nudrat Hassan,1,"The staff at this store did not help me at all. I approached to two staff, they just made me call the Apple support then left for break. The third staff kept on telling me he doesn’t know anything.I went with the issue with my app, made me call the Apple support and Apple support asking me to go to store. I’m so frustrated at this point at the lack of professionalism."
6/15/2025,Itzik Samara,5,The apple employee helped me a lot . Explaining.. comparing between products.. helped me with discounts and trades in..  great store
6/15/2025,Nellie W,1,"Don’t bother wasting your time here. Made an appointment online for an iPhone battery replacement only to be told they don’t have any in stock. They tried telling us to go to the U Village store then came out saying, whoops just kidding that battery isn’t available. Why even allow people to make an appointment (specifically for a battery replacement) if you don’t even have any in stock?? Absolute waste of our time."

6/15/2025,Darren Ruh,5,Fast service. Always on their game at Apple.
6/15/2025,Mario Moreno,3,"First of all, I want to give them the benefit of doubt because the store was busy, but after 20 min of no one approaching, I go ask an associate that I just want to buy a mac mini, told me that there is a queue and I have to wait, I guess thats fair, but other 5 o 10 min of me just standing waiting and the associate also just standing there waiting, I figure he is waiting for someone and is going to take even longer. Fortunately, the associate in the pickup was available and I just ask if he could get me the mac mini, to just pay and go, and finally was done. Overall, kind of a bad experience as a walk-in, even considering that I already knew what I wanted, and not because of the waiting itself, but rather how chaotic is to buy, from what I observe, you basically have to go interrupt someone to make sure you eventually get service or wait indefinitely because it looked like no one was organizing or keeping track.Honestly, I just didn't want to write my credit card info in the webpage to just pick it up and figure it would be faster to go in person to buy and oh boy I was wrong."

4/15/2025,Ke Xu,1,"So I went to the store today to return something I’d ordered before. Everything was going fine until the guy helping me (apparently a “genius” there?) randomly asked where I’m from. When I told him, he got super weird about it—like, visibly disappointed? It felt kinda shady tbh. I’m not saying it was straightup racist, but definitely not professional in any sense. I checked the store’s reviews and LOL—so many 1-star rants about similar stuff. I’m never coming back here. 0/10 would not recommend."

4/15/2025,Marta Kostroma,1,"Today my mom and I went to this store to get some information about the iPad. The sales associate was visibly irritated when we didn’t understand something, and when he found out we weren’t planning to make a purchase today, he walked away in frustration. I didn’t realize that apparently, you’re not allowed to ask questions unless you’re buying something right away. The other guy who was showing us the watches also rolled his eyes and seemed like he just wanted us to leave as quickly as possible. It was an unpleasant experience. Both guys are azian if that help to explain them how to communicate with people."

4/15/2025,Sergey K,1,Apparently same day service appointments mean nothing to these people. What a complete waste of my time. Drove there after making an appointment to replace my battery only to be told that they didn't have time for me that day. PATHETIC! I will never visit this location again. ZERO STARS!
4/15/2025,John Chyan,5,"Lorie, the store manager at the Apple Store in Bellevue Square, is absolutely awesome! I came in with an issue with my Beats earbuds—there was a static noise coming from the left earbud. I had already visited the store twice, and while the Genius Bar rep was able to hear and duplicate the issue and sent it out for repair, the Beats Repair facility unfortunately sent it back without doing anything. Super frustrating.Thankfully, on my third visit, Lorie stepped in to help. She was incredibly kind, professional, and really took the time to listen and understand the problem. She immediately recognized the issue and resolved it without wasting any time. I truly appreciated her support and can’t thank her enough for turning a frustrating experience into a positive one!"
4/15/2025,Jr Ramirez,1,"This place sucks!!I drove 80 miles one way to see them because the tech on the phone assured me my battery would be covered under my Apple care plan that I’ve been paying for for 4+ years.I get there and Ian or Ethan was my rep. Can’t miss him. He looks like the guy from Masters of disguise the movie, when he dressed up as the turtle guy. Bald head, glasses and stalky dude.Right from the get-go, super condescending attitude. No matter what I said, he would shut it down. Catherine services I was gonna get done and spent another $1500 in repairs out of my pocket which I was happy to do until he showed up. He directed me to his manager, another young and entitled girl. Couldn’t miss her. She was the bigger person out of all the managers.Out of frustration, I just gave up and walked away. This place in Bellevue with all these entitled people there really give the brand a really BAD reputation.I am considering exploring other options. I’ve bought tens of thousands of dollars in products and merchandise from them just to be treated like a number.Negative stars for this place would be appropriate. Apple, please do better. You are nothing without the clients. Steve Jobs would be turning in his grave if he ever was treated this way by a low paying customer service “representative”.👎🏻👎🏻"
4/15/2025,Alex,1,"I ALWAYS ALWAYS waste of my time to talk to ""genius"" at Apple Stores. By far the ""genius"" that I chatted here was the worst. He didn't even introduce himself, he manipulated what I said, and blaming customers for no reason."

3/15/2025,Arundhati Roy,1,Date of Visit: Feb 17th 2025 @10 amTook an appointment for Genius Bar for my AirPods.Went to the store. No sign where is the Genius Bar. You can see people working on the table like a cafe.Check in process is horrible. First you have to ‘Find’ a person with a tab for which there is no process. I told him that I have come for 2 things one AirPods and then trade in values of my phone.I was checked in and the guy took my air pod and said it needed repair. During this process there was another customer right on our face listening to the convo. Very weird experience.The people do not wear visible name tags so it is hard to get to know their name. He did not say his name. There is a saying in Customer Service if you do not like the face of your customer move to the next one. Let someone else handle them. My AirPods failed the test and I should have got a new one as per the program. But did not.After we were done with my AirPods I asked what about my phone. He said what about it? That simply means the person who checkedin did not write why the customer was there. He directed me to a Tradein section and said someone will come to help me. Here the fun begins 15 mins no one shows up. People are moving randomly. So no visibility of who came first to the store.I went to another guy to ask the same thing. At this point I have repeated this trade in to 3 people. He pointed to the guy who was in pick up section which was super weird.This guy was the kindest soul in the store. Cory I think he introduced himself. He gave a price and all went perfect!Please stop this crap about open concept. In customer service it should be FIFO. As simple as that. Passing off to 4 people is not a good customer service experience.I have been to Genius Bar before in NY and they are amazing. The manager i feel supports this rude behaviors and does not care about the store reviews since it is situated in a very high traffic mall. Google Reviews have become useless as no business cares anymore.

3/15/2025,Derrick Connell,4,Purchased a product online and picked up in store. The staff had to deal with some technical issues as their handhelds wouldn’t connect so they couldn’t check me out. Staff dealt with it professionally but Apple can afford to invest more in front line software for customers

2/15/2025,Fang Zhiwei,1,"I am writing to share the absolutely ridiculous experience I had at the Apple Store in Bellevue Square. I took my iPhone in because the back camera glass was scratched and dented. Since I have AppleCare—and have had this exact issue fixed at this very store before—I expected them to help me. Instead, a staff member flatly told me that it was just a “cosmetic issue” and therefore not eligible for repair. I found this completely unreasonable and inconsistent, considering they had repaired this same issue previously.Naturally, I questioned their so-called “standard” for deciding what’s fixable. I even asked, “If the phone were actually broken, would you fix it?” Their response? A dismissive, “Sorry, that’s policy.” Frustrated, I left the store, called AppleCare, and also asked friends about their repair experiences. I felt compelled to give it another shot, so I made a second appointment an hour later. While waiting outside, my phone accidentally fell to the ground—an unfortunate mishap, but things happen.When I returned for my second appointment, I waited a few minutes before a senior manager named J came out. Shockingly, he wasted no time accusing me of deliberately breaking my own phone just to force a repair under AppleCare. I asked him how he reached that baseless conclusion, and he admitted he hadn’t seen me do anything at all—he simply “put the pieces together” because I’d inquired earlier about fixing a broken device, then came back with a phone that was now more damaged. Based on that flimsy logic, he decided I must have damaged it on purpose. Then he lectured me on how I was “wrong” to do that!He took less than five minutes to gather whatever information he thought he needed from the staff, and then left a note on my account effectively banning my phone from being serviced at any Apple Store. Meanwhile, when I showed up on time for both of my appointments, I had to wait at least ten minutes just for someone to help me. It’s astonishing how quickly they jump to accuse and punish paying customers, yet they show no sense of urgency when it comes to actually providing customer service.This ordeal was beyond disappointing—being unfairly accused and then barred from service, all without any real evidence, is both insulting and outrageous. If this is how Apple treats customers who simply want a device repaired under a valid AppleCare plan, I can’t imagine what they consider “proper” customer care.When I spoke with J, he told me, “This iPhone will be excluded from any service at any Apple Store. You did this the wrong way. The only option is to buy a new one.” He seemed to be enjoying himself while lecturing me, practically smirking the whole time. Yet when I contacted another Apple Store later, they said they could do an out-of-warranty repair for around $200—meaning there was an alternative to buying an entirely new device.Clearly, J misled me, never mentioning this out-of-warranty repair option. He acted like purchasing a brand-new iPhone was the only solution. I can’t believe a senior manager—someone who’s supposed to lead an Apple Store—would take an adversarial stance toward a customer and show such skill in punishing rather than helping.I’ve already filed a complaint about this awful experience."

2/15/2025,Co co,1,"There is nobody come to help me only words the front man said is to call the customer service, and I seek other people’s help, and in the middle of assisting the person went away and left we there have nobody help for a long time. This is suck experience. And as I saw other customers, they help them somehow, and also it is a discrimination."

2/15/2025,SJ Chen,5,"I want to sincerely thank Courtney and Sam from the Apple Store at Bellevue Square for their exceptional help! After countless frustrating interactions with Apple’s phone support, where I got absolutely nowhere and felt like I was just going in circles, these two stepped in and resolved my issue right away. Their professionalism, kindness, and efficiency made all the difference. I’m so grateful for their help—having amazing staff like Courtney and Sam at this store is truly invaluable!"
2/15/2025,Minhua Wang,1,"Do Not do trade in with Apple directly. They do appraisal like the phone you bring in are stolen from someone else, and always try to give you the lowest value. Very disappointed"
2/15/2025,Joshua camacho,5,"I had an exceptional experience at the Apple store thanks to Cesar! From the moment I walked in, he greeted me with a warm smile and a friendly attitude. Cesar’s knowledge about Apple products is impressive, and he took the time to thoroughly understand my needs before recommending the perfect device. He patiently answered all my questions, making complex technical details easy to understand.What truly set Cesar apart was his genuine passion for helping customers. He went above and beyond to ensure I was comfortable with my purchase, offering personalized tips and setting up my new device with ease. His professionalism, combined with his personable approach, made my visit truly enjoyable. If you’re visiting the Apple store, I highly recommend asking for Cesar—he’s a gem! Thanks to him, I left with not just a new device, but a great customer service experience as well.Gracias Cesar ❤️"

1/15/2025,Sharan Anil Kumar,5,"This is my fav Apple Store around Seattle area. I always ask for Cesar when it comes to Genius Bar and any service requirements from my apple devices. I have worked with multiple reps at this store and no one is close to Cesar his knowledge, the way he cares for us. He embodies apples culture the best, something a few reps in this store can learn from."
1/15/2025,Wenkan Zhu,1,I will give 0 star if I can. The guys in the store are very stupid and denying their problem when we did everything right for our trade in.When I pointed out what’s wrong on their side they got mad and keep saying I’m not being nice enough. How come apple hired these people with so much ego and no professional ability?Nowadays Apple Store has become Starbucks while those stuff still dreaming they’re working in Hermes.
1/15/2025,Emre Guler,1,"It was the worst experience of my life. I struggled for 20 minutes just to buy an iPad Pro. Apparently, there were no staff available. This is the first time I’ve encountered a group of employees who have no idea what they’re doing."
1/15/2025,McBethmane,5,I didn't know apple had so many people working. I also like how they offer tech help classes... I was in and out quick.
1/15/2025,Apollo Martin,5,"The employees here are great. It was very busy and a lot of customers were very angry about unreasonable things in front of me and I’m just sitting there like 😮. It is not the employees fault that it is the busiest time of year or that you don’t understand that there are rules. Some customers were racist in front of me. Others were trying to haggle the technicians as if they’re trading sheep. What is going on in Bellevue… Like… I just came to fix my phone. It was very fast for the amount of people, and Alex was very helpful at the Genius Bar. 10/10."
1/15/2025,A H,2,"Wait was 40 minutes to check out.  When I ran into the store manager, and I mentioned my Long wait, he dismissed my comment that “we’re too busy.”  I expected the store manager to be a bit more diplomatic specially at an Apple Store.  I almost laughed."
1/15/2025,Wade Miller,2,Scheduled an appointment... was sent to the wrong person by the check-in person. Was asked to wait. Waited over an hour before complaining. I only complained because 6 employees were paired up just chatting. Finally was helped by a very nice person. I only own one apple product... I will not be purchasing more.
1/15/2025,Earl Barlow,4,Ok
1/15/2025,E Z,1,made an appointment for vision pro demo and arrived at time. Was assigned a seat and then demo staff went to help other customers. No communication that let me know what I was waiting for or how soon I can get my demo started. I waited for 30 mins then left. Vision pro demo staff seem unhappy about their work and do not care about customers at all.
