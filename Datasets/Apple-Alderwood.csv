9/3/2025,Nick Ar,1,"Don't Waste Your Money on This Overpriced GarbageI've been an unfortunate Apple customer for years, and I can honestly say this company has completely lost its way. What used to be a premium brand has turned into an overpriced nightmare with zero accountability.The Worst Customer Service in TechLet me start with their customer service - it's absolutely the worst I've ever encountered. Getting help is like pulling teeth. You'll spend hours on hold, get transferred between departments multiple times, and speak to representatives who clearly don't care about solving your problems. They read from scripts, offer generic solutions that don't work, and act like they're doing YOU a favor by taking your call. When you finally escalate to a supervisor, they're just as useless. It's like they actively train their staff to be unhelpful.iCloud: Where Your Data Goes to DieAnd don't even get me started on iCloud - it's real garbage that loses information all the time. I've lost photos, contacts, documents, and backups more times than I can count. One day your files are there, the next day they've vanished into thin air. Their ""seamless sync"" is a joke. I've had wedding photos disappear, important work documents corrupted, and contact lists randomly deleted. When you contact support about it? They shrug and tell you it's your fault somehow.Overpriced Hardware That BreaksTheir devices are ridiculously overpriced for what you get. A simple cable costs $30 when you can get the same thing elsewhere for $5. Their phones have batteries that die after a year, screens that crack if you look at them wrong, and they slow down your device with updates to force you to buy new ones.The Apple Tax is RealEverything costs 3x more than it should. Want more storage? Pay through the nose. Need a dongle because they removed all the ports? That'll be $50. Repair? Forget about it - they'd rather sell you a new device.Final VerdictSave your money and your sanity. There are better alternatives that actually respect their customers and don't treat you like a walking ATM. Apple has become everything it once stood against - greedy, anti-consumer, and completely out of touch."
8/26/2025,Isabella Nuttall,5,Okay I WISH I remembered his name but the worker there that has a bunch of baseball game scores on his Lock Screen and was there to help me when I yardsaled my phone into Lake Washington made my day SO much better after striking out at TMobile! He was super tall and had a tattoo sleeve.  I think he was a manager and I can see why! Thank you so much for the help! You turned my entire day around!
8/19/2025,jjs,1,"After buying a new laptop, I was waiting for help transferring info from old to new laptop. The first employee was about to take a break, talked to the next employee for about ten minutes concerning a date planned for the weekend. Second employee then talked to more employees and the returning first employee about the same date. I just walked out with my computer, and never got the old data transfered."
8/15/2025,Sergiy Slobodyan,1,Wait time is ridiculously long. Some dudes are staying doing nothing but they can't help because only the only person is certified to bring you a phone. Probably should buy online next time.
8/15/2025,Anna Bondarenko,1,"I came to make an appointment and the closest one was of 3.5 hours waiting time. I‚Äôve got a text message and checked in and they tell me to wait for the available technician. It‚Äôs been a half hour wait already and I‚Äôm still here waiting for someone. STUFF ARE RUDE. When we asked when is someone going to help us , they told us to just wait again, and when we asked what the point in appointment then they gave us rude answer."
8/15/2025,Rostyslav,1,"We with my wife did appointment,  was waiting 3 hours to our appointment, Come in and, waiting 45 min after time to our appointment it‚Äôs crazy every body free, nobody helps it‚Äôs so bad service, if you need some help, find a different store ü§ùü´°"
8/15/2025,Jacqueline Delsuc,5,"Today was wild. Thank you to Joseph, from yesterday, for all his help and efficiency. Thank you to Tapha, from this afternoon, he was very patient and kind. He was even late to his lunch for us, so sorry! I hope my sister‚Äôs funny password made up for your time! And Thank you to Tavis, from this afternoon taking over for Tapha‚Äôs lunch. He was able to help us out with a funky backing-up issue we were having and really alleviated a lot of stress and prevented more issues from arising in the future! So excited about our tech upgrades. Thanks, Lynnwood Team!"
8/15/2025,Michael Toohey,5,"I don‚Äôt usually frequent this kind of store, mostly because I‚Äôm a ‚Äútake care of it myself‚Äù kinda guy and I don‚Äôt favor malls or big stores. Came in today because I smashed my phone to pieces skateboarding and desperately needed help. Customer service was next level. They were super patient with me, helped me immensely and turned what I would have normally considered a hassle into a wonderful experience. Visit this store for your Apple needs and if you‚Äôre fortunate enough to be assisted by Mercedes I can assure you she will brighten your day. As a customer service specialist with over 20 years in customer service facing roles, I would give Mercedes 10 stars if I could. 10/10. Thank you Mercedes for going the extra mile and taking such good care of me!"

8/15/2025,Emad Bisada,5,
8/15/2025,Chrissy Sills,2,"They (sort of) helped me. But also acted super inconvenienced by me having 2-3 questions that took up more than 5 minutes of their time. I was in and out of the store in under 15 minutes, spent a cool $330, left with unanswered questions, and was made to feel like I was such a bother."
8/15/2025,Robert Selfe,1,Was told by Best Buy to come here to reset password for my Apple ID. The store LOCKED my Apple ID now I have to wait a week to be able to change my password. There had another guy in the store that was locked out for OVER 2 months!!!
8/15/2025,Rico Diaz,1,"Today I visited the Genius Bar with questions about my phone. The initial contact was pleasant and professional, and the technician quickly diagnosed that my phone needed to be replaced.However, things took a turn when I was handed off to a sales associate. The associate was rude, did not introduce himself, didn‚Äôt ask for my name, and provided no product information or assistance. He was dismissive and unwilling to help with my questions or concerns.This experience was frustrating and disappointing. I expected a higher level of service, especially after such a good start. I recommend avoiding this store and looking elsewhere for help and support."
8/12/2025,K S,1,"I have apple care, I contacted support before coming in and they verified this store could help. They couldn‚Äôt. Had to wait 2 hours for them to say they can‚Äôt support that."

7/15/2025,Pallavi Gulati,3,"Crowded, ensure you have an appointment before coming. A lot of stuff like watch bands were out of stock"
7/15/2025,Vivian Chou,1,"Worst Apple Store experience ever. I came in to buy an iPhone and was asked to wait for a sales associate. After waiting over 20 minutes, no one ever showed up to help. The store wasn‚Äôt even crowded‚Äîthere seemed to be just as many employees as customers. It feels like Apple has gotten too big to care about individual customers anymore."

7/15/2025,Brittain Boswell,5,"Had an issue with my charger, was in and out with it fixed in about 10 minutes. Super nice people."
7/15/2025,James Davidson,1,"Abysmal customer service.I went into this location at 12:30pm today to drop my laptop off for a new battery. I was told I had to come back at 2:00 because that was the next available time they had to ‚Äúmeet with me‚Äù. I told them I wasn‚Äôt interested in waiting an hour and a half to meet with them, and that I would like to just drop the laptop off to get a new battery, and that I‚Äôd be back to pick it up whenever it is done.They told me that was not an option, and that if I wanted my laptop fixed, I had to come back for the 2 o‚Äôclock appointment because that is when they would be available to take the laptop from me. I‚Äôm not sure why they couldn‚Äôt just take it when I was already sitting there with laptop in hand, But I suppose that would just be a little too logical for a company like Apple.I walked back in at 1:55 PM, laptop in hand. I was told by the kid upfront that my appointment had been moved back ten minutes to 2:10 PM, But that they would check me in to their system.At 2:10pm, I had still received zero customer service. Same thing goes for 2:20 PM, and 2:30 PM. It wasn‚Äôt until 2:40pm that someone finally paid me a lick of attention.That was two hours and ten minutes after I had originally arrived - 40 minutes after I had been promised ‚Äúan appointment‚Äù with an Apple employee.I should have expected nothing less from a company who values the image of their brick and mortar locations over their actual customer service skills."
7/15/2025,Derek Q. Van,1,Empty store but would need an appointmentüòè
7/15/2025,Kwokmun Lee,2,I needed help at the Apple store and a person who was helping another customer saw me and told me that someone is going to be with me shortly. I was standing there and there were three associates who stood in the vicinity but none cared to approach me to ask if I needed help.
7/15/2025,S P.,4,"The staff was really helpful, didn't push anything on me, and gave me the phone I asked for. I needed a new case, and üì∫ protector. So why not have her put the thing on with no bubbles at all. And the cases there are colors that look perfect for iPhone 16 colors. I got a 16+. It's the exact same size as my old 12 pro max. I didn't want a bigger one and I wanted to get the blue color. I also saw a nifty Pride themed watch band. So I got that too and talked about random things while my Apple ID transferred everything from a backup to the new phone, and out the door.The only reason they get a four is because Apple stores should be in every mall and not an hour away and a $40 ferry ride. They can't help that, but Steve Wozniak sure would have."
7/15/2025,Tina,5,
7/15/2025,Danielia Lewis,2,"Went I went into the store no one asked if I needed assistance or asked me to wait. I was looking for a jack to my iPhone 14, turns out they don‚Äôt sell them anymore.. the associate that helped me was rude and condescending"
6/15/2025,Simon,1,"This Asian lady at genius bar today at 11:35 was very rude and dismissive. As I was describing the problem, she was cutting me off frequently and said the crack on my phone was not a crack after glancing at it for less than 1 second, and said that'll be $375 to fix it. She was overall very dismissive, interrupted constantly, and wanted to end the conversation as soon as possible. She did not mention any additional detail or context such as diagnosis until I had to ask for them. Also, she was so confident interrupting me about information I mentioned on T-mobile stores, somehow representing Tmobile. I find that absurdly rude and unprofessional.Overall pretty disappointing experience driving all the way here for such kind of service. Never seen this in 10 years interacting with Apple stores"

6/15/2025,JM,1,"Zero customer service, blatant lies told by employees, also screwed up access to my replacement phone. Workers are rude including the manager. I honestly cant think of anything this place does correctly. This is the third time I‚Äôve been there and all three times it has been a completely miserable experience.  But hey‚Ä¶no matter what apple will always make their money. This place has convinced me to never support apple again. This is one customer they lost and I know that doesn‚Äôt matter to them."
6/15/2025,Gerald Vasquez,5,"Very informative and helpful representative! Since I chose not to buy while there, she emailed me information on all the items we discussed."
6/15/2025,Andrii Manakov,1,"Worst Apple Store experience ever.This is by far the worst store I‚Äôve ever been to in the U.S. The service was absolutely terrible. There were barely any customers in the store, yet no one could help us. We sat for over an hour while employees walked around doing nothing. It felt like they were intentionally wasting our time. No one seemed to care or take any initiative. For the amount of money we spend at Apple, this kind of service is completely unacceptable. The price we pay does not match the quality of service at all. This store is a complete disaster."
6/15/2025,K K,1,"I had a terrible experience at the Apple Store with my 7-month-old iPhone 16 Pro Max, which is still under warranty. The store manager was rude, dismissive, and acted like the store was their personal property. I brought my phone in for a rebooting issue; the screen, camera, and body were pristine and scratch-free. They claimed the phone was bent‚Äîdespite no visible damage‚Äîand demanded ~$550 for repairs without explaining the cause, which parts needed replacement, or why the repair was necessary. When I asked for details, the manager refused to clarify and told me to either pay or leave ‚Äúmy store.‚Äù This lack of transparency and poor service for an in-warranty, flawless phone is completely unacceptable. No written diagnosis or documentation was provided."
6/15/2025,Duncan Rutherford,3,"As others have mentioned, wait times here are obnoxiously long, I needed a new iPhone and it took over 45 minutes just for someone to come help me get one. After I actually got someone to help me, the experience was great. The staff member helping me was very nice and made sure I got all of my data transferred over and was happy with my new phone. I really wish they would do something about the wait times though, that really detracted from the overall experience. I likely won‚Äôt return"
6/15/2025,Gabby,5,"Good selection, nice staff, we didn't have to stand around too long before we were greeted. Overall positive experience."

5/15/2025,Agyys D,5,Quick service. Useful help. All went smoothly.I changed iPhone battery and it took me only 1 hour. It was on Tuesday noon.
5/15/2025,John Genis,5,"Camera went out on my phone. Service was instant. Repair was completed in 45 minutes. $180 out the door, and he threw on a free screen protector for me. Much appreciated!"
5/15/2025,R Patone,1,"I wish I could give negative stars. I call to try and get a copy of my receipt and the salesperson told me I had to come into the store to get it because they sell thousands of them daily. I told him I only bought one couldn't he just look up my name and he said and I quote "" I told you you have to come into the store"" he was very rude. This is why the minimum wage should be lowered and only salespeople who get higher pay are the ones who actually care  about where they work and care about the customer. If we all stop going into the store and just buy online those store will close down and now they are jobless. Hey Apple hire people who actually care about your customers."
4/15/2025,Silvia Jadali,5,Great store
4/15/2025,Thao Cox,5,Lars is a wonderful person that enrich people life for the better! Thank you Lars for educating me to make informed decision! I hope you will impact the world to become kinder and safer place :) Thao

4/15/2025,Nabil Altaa,1,Not helpful. I waited 45 minutes despite  have appointment. The first guy did not check me in when I first entered.
4/15/2025,Ris k,1,Staff not courteous and lacks knowledge about products. Poorly organized store. Always overcrowded plus the staff is too slow. Zombies would work faster. Have been to multiple apple stores but this looks like all chaos broke loose here. Choose another store and save yourself your time.
3/15/2025,Heather Smith,5,"People in the Apple store want you to spend your  money. That's 100% understandable, however today Evan actually saved me money instead of selling me something that I really didn't need.  Exemplary customer service."
