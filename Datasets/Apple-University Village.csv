8/26/2025,Johnathen Johnson,5,"Justin Is a Rockstar!Justin‚Äôs energy and dedication were next-level. He handled my repair with speed and precision, and his communication was spot-on the entire time. It‚Äôs rare to find someone who‚Äôs both technically sharp and genuinely caring. Apple is lucky to have him, and I‚Äôm lucky I got him as my rep. Five stars all the way!This Apple Store has the most insightful and detail-oriented workforce I‚Äôve ever come across. While I was being assisted with my repair, multiple members of the Apple team checked in to make sure I was being helped and taken care of. It‚Äôs the healthiest atmosphere I‚Äôve ever seen in an Apple Store to date.They even offer cool little tutorials at this location‚Äîdisplayed on a big screen‚Äîcovering unique app knowledge, how-to tools, and hidden functions. It‚Äôs like a tech masterclass while you wait."

8/15/2025,teya williams,5,"After a disappointing customer experience on a previous visit‚Ä¶Yesterday 7/12/25 Charlie provided me with the 10/10 experience I needed!I walked in with my screen protector replacement. He greeted me, I told him I could use some help, he saw the box and said ‚Äúokay it looks like you‚Äôve got a screen protector replacement, step right over here and I‚Äôll get you set up!!!‚ÄùAnother gentleman walked in with an issue he told him he‚Äôd be happy to help when he was finished, and asked him to sit and wait where he might get help sooner.The replacement took no time, he kept up some banter while working on it, got my approval and sent me on my way.The store wasn‚Äôt busy when I walked in, that could have helped with the pace & response, but I get the sense that Charlie just get‚Äôs it. He fully understands why he is there. Yes ultimately to make sales, but also provide a customer experience!I appreciate you Charlie! 10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏èü§©"
8/15/2025,Rinlita Itthikomolsil,1,"Bad customer service. I had an appointment at 1:40 p.m. I arrived at 1:30 p.m. After talking with the first staff member who helped me check in, I needed to wait for 40 minutes with no one coming to help. I asked them twice at 15 minutes and 30 minutes. They said someone will come to help you soon. I waited and ended up with the conclusion that they could not help me with my iPad problem."

8/12/2025,ved vartak,1,I went to the repair store called as genius bar with a cellular issue. Without even debugging the guy said they need to repair my entire back panel worth 500 dollars. A simple backup and restore was the solution to bring up cellular.
8/12/2025,Toni P,4,"Visitamos el Apple Store de University Village y nos decepcion√≥ un poco. Esper√°bamos algo m√°s llamativo o especial, como en otras tiendas de la marca, pero este nos pareci√≥ bastante b√°sico, sin elementos diferenciales ni experiencias destacables. Cumple su funci√≥n, pero no tiene ese ‚Äúwow‚Äù que hemos visto en otros Apple Store."

The technology employee I worked with was fine, but his superior was hostile and was preparing to throw me out.The problem was about how loud the superior was with a client right next to us. I couldn‚Äôt hear what my tech was telling me.It all accelerated on the part of the Apple employees till I left,being told they would never let me in again."

4/15/2025,Joanna Dunaj,1,Went there yesterday to get some basic earphones. The sales person didn't give me the receipt for the purchase and made me feel like I should leave the store immediately after I paid with cash. It was only 20 dollars and I wanted to pay cash. The second he heard that I only want to buy the earphones and pay cash he became borderline hostile. What is the deal with not giving a receipt?
4/15/2025,Scott Harron,2,"Disjointed, distracted customer service (if you can call that service). Wait! Where did the person who was helping me go? Apple tries too hard to be cool and not hard enough to actually be helpful."

4/15/2025,Peter Park,1,Couldn't get help ti buy new phone on weekday. Waiting for more than 15 mins. STAFF NEEDS TO WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY. they had enough employees but not willing to help/sell.Just expect more than 20 mins waiting for anything in this store.
4/15/2025,Robert Wells,1,"Disabled with epilepsy. Called 2hrs+ w/Apple support and store the day before, explaining reasonable accommodation per ADA (American disability Act).I need constant communication with my Dr and emergency contacts in case of seizure.Apple erased all info on my phone, then said they couldn‚Äôt help me cause I have Verizon. ‚ÄúGo to Verizon‚Äù.Again I explained my situation and asked for reasonable accommodation per ADA, if they could call Verizon or do anything for me. They refused and said they DID NOT have to follow the ADA.They put me in a corner of the store away from customers. Told me I had a seizure, then made me leave.I walked around for over an hour before I recovered and realized what I was doing. Took me hours to get to Verizon and I didn‚Äôt make it home till 8pm. I arrived at Apple at 12:40. Phone was ‚Äúrepaired‚Äù by 2:20.They never informed me they would NOT be able to get my phone working again since I have Verizon. I explained to them all my info. I recorded the phone calls and am reporting all of this to the DOJ for Apple violating title iii of the ADA.Here‚Äôs proof that they can help with Verizon. Their own survey says they can!!!The manager said if I wanted to file a complaint against any of his employees then I would never be allowed in the store again.Blown away. Never supporting Apple again. Tempted to literally get rid of all Apple products after this experience. I don‚Äôt feel safe in their stores now."

3/15/2025,azhin m,1,"Disappointed with Apple‚Äôs Repair ServiceI had my iPhone screen replaced at the Apple Store just two months ago, and now my phone has water damage. When I took it back to Apple, expecting some accountability, they refused to help. Their response? ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt related to the screen replacement.‚ÄùThis makes no sense‚Äîmy phone was working fine before the repair, and now it‚Äôs unusable because water got in. If the screen replacement wasn‚Äôt done properly, it could have compromised the phone‚Äôs water resistance. But instead of taking responsibility, Apple just dismissed my concerns."
3/15/2025,Azhin M.,1,Very disappointed
3/15/2025,Bronson Shonk,1,"Disappointing customer service - I went in with an issue and was told my logic board would need to be replaced. It was communicated to me that there would be a potential for data loss. I had a lot of my important data backed up in google cloud, but not everything. When I got the repair back I learned that a replaced logic board meant a complete data wipe. Would have loved to know that going into the repair so I could think more seriously about what I had and did not have backed up. It would have been a very easy thing to communicate. The only reason I can come up with for why this simple piece of information was not communicated would be that the ""genius"" did not know that this was the case."

2/15/2025,Pascal Blumenthal,1,"I'm sure this is a fine botique for Apple's products, but I've found its repair staff to be seriously lacking in experience, and at times dangerously negligent. You could find better service at any number of private repair shops in Seattle, which are less inclined to upsell you and take personal accountability for their work. When I took my laptop in for a standard battery replacement, I was assured that the staff on hand would be more than capable of taking care of it in a timely manner. Fast forward a week, and they were still doing repairs (on different parts which they had broken themselves). At one point, I was contacted and told that a logic board replacement would be necessary to fix a faulty fingerprint scanner. When I pushed back and said this didn't seem like a necessary repair, they said it was still reccomended in case of ""underlying issues"". They did not inform me that on Macs, the logic board is attached to the hard drive, which they proceded to replace. It was assumed that I knew this hardware fact, but even if this were a fair assumption, the words ""hard drive"" should have come up at some point in that conversation if they were going to alter it in any way, shape or form. Anyway, my computer is wiped, and I wish that were the end of it. However, even though these items went beyond the scope of the original work order, and were not Apple's property, my old drive was effectively confiscated when I might still have used it to recover valuable data. I walked away feeling as though I had been hustled by a sketchy auto shop, and going forward I will certainly be more wary. I highly suggest that customers of this store educate themselves about their products before handing them over, and be skeptical when a technician offers an optional part replacement without mentioning any potential downsides. In my case, that downside was the total loss of my hard drive. It wasn't just a possibility, either. It was guaranteed, and no efforts were made on my behalf. I hope this review finds some other people before they can make a similar mistake."

2/15/2025,Leah Penney,5,"I had a Genius Bar appointment with John last week to see what my options were to repair or replace my damaged laptop. He was patient and explained all of my options in a way that was easy to understand. I was nervous about going to this appointment by myself because I don‚Äôt know all that much about computers, but by the end I felt like I had all the information I needed! John‚Äôs patience and thorough explanations made what could have been a very stressful situation much less stressful.This was my first time visiting the Genius Bar, but after this experience I would not hesitate to come back even if I‚Äôm just shopping for a new product next time. Thanks John for the assistance!"
2/15/2025,D St Louis,1,"This Store screams inefficiency and incompetence. one person greets you, another sits you down to wait for the 3rd person who will take 15 mins to arrive. Meanwhile there are many employees just standing and walking around. Then you get help and your helper is running back and forth asking others what do. If you have lots of time to waste, this is a great place."

2/15/2025,Chandler Johnston,1,"I recently visited the Apple University Village seeking help with my iPhone 12 Pro after it unexpectedly became inoperable during a system update. Despite following recommended troubleshooting steps and consulting with Apple Support, the device could not be restored. Unfortunately, the in-store team was unable to offer a meaningful resolution beyond a $60 trade-in. Which was an offer that felt inadequate given the original cost and my expectations of product longevity.This experience has been deeply frustrating. I have always associated Apple with quality products and excellent customer service, but this encounter did not reflect those values. A critical failure during a routine software update should warrant more substantial support."

1/15/2025,Andre Stepanov,1,"TLDR: Horrible experience. Inept employee. Doesn't understand the hardware. Made me waste my entire day.So frustrating. Will avoid this Apple Store in the future. ‚ÄúGenuis‚Äù bar is full of idiots.My Experience:I came into the store asking to repair the front and back of my phone after dropping a weight on it. I had the unfortunate experience of meeting the genius bar tech, Andrea. She said something about not being able to verify that the screen was broken along with the back glass?Okay...? I don‚Äôt care. I am asking you to repair my phone and I am paying for it. What does it matter when it broke? Fix the front and the back.Kept saying some BS about adding stuff to her notes. Kind of mumbling under her breath completely unclear what she is describing. Couldn‚Äôt explain WHY it mattered when the front screen broke relative to the back (even though once again, they broke on the same day).Then eventually out of nowhere she goes, ""there is a dent at the in the frame of the phone, you can feel it"". No, actually, you can‚Äôt feel anything and there was no dent! The said ""dent"" was also on the complete opposite side from the point of impact... Continued to sit there for a bit and said the only option I have was to get a replacement phone for $700 or $800... NO. I am not getting a new phone when the hardware AND software in this one is completely fine. So horrible for the environment and completely unnecessary. I sat there for a second processing the BS that she just spewed my way and decided to just go to another repair shop.Went to Best Buy, but since my screen didn‚Äôt work, they didn‚Äôt have the tools to authorize the repair. But, they agreed, no dent. I had to drive to Bellevue during rush hour to another Apple store. There I talked to a wonderful employee who worked with me and said ""of course we can get this fixed for you. You want the front and back repaired?"" EZ PZ. Not so hard after all. Got it fixed the same day and picked it up later that night with no data loss! Who would‚Äôve thought?! Certainly not an Apple Store GENIUS!The thing is, I had my meeting with Andrea at 1:30. Because of her incompetence, I had to drive around until 9:00 to get it fixed when I could‚Äôve had it all done by 4. She wasted my day, and I know Apple is going to do nothing to make it right.Horrible experience. Inept employee. Doesn't understand the hardware. Made me waste my entire day.So frustrating. Will avoid this Apple Store in the future. ‚ÄúGenuis‚Äù bar is full of idiots."

1/15/2025,John Jordan,1,"Spent hours here trying to diagnose an issue with an iphone camera that started immediately after a software update.  Their diagnostic said that the camera was fine, but they wanted to replace it anyway at my cost.  When I refused to pay when it was Apple's update that resulted in the camera issue, the response I received was basically, ""Sometimes camera hardware is just on the verge of breaking and a software update pushes it over, so this isn't Apple's fault it's yours because your phone is out of warranty.""Either Apple is making bad quality phones that last less than 2 years (phone was out of the 1 year warranty but less than 2 years old) or the software update issued by them caused the camera issue.  Either way this store won't take ownership of a problem that I think is Apple's issue and at the end of the day couldn't show what the actual problem even was.  The phone has had zero damage and all diagnostics performed said no hardware problems were found, yet the solution proposed was charging money to replace hardware which may or may not be the issue.I then had to navigate a warranty claim with Verizon because it was less expensive than paying Apple what they asked, but was very difficult as I couldn't prove a hardware issue since the camera that Apple wanted to replace seemed fine.  Verizon eventually helped me work through things and replaced my phone, but it should have been Apple.  Whether the camera was defective or the software update wasn't working correctly, this was an Apple issue since the phone was never damaged."

12/15/2024,Megan Rowland,2,"I am not critiquing this store necessarily, but Apple customer service in general. I was out of the country last week and did an ios update on my eight month old phone. The phone quit responding after that update and now will not turn on. I took it into the Apple store, and they told me it was not the update but the crack on the bottom of my screen. I would be quite willing to acknowledge it could be the crack if I had noticed any problems before the update, but the phone was functioning perfectly and right after the update quit working - I am bummed at Apple's lack of ownership and respect towards their customers, and will most likely not buy another Apple product after buying their products exclusively for the last 15 years."

12/15/2024,theo olson,1,Store shut down on Black Friday 2024 because store security and employees were scared of peaceful protesters. This ruined our Black Friday shopping and Apple lost thousands of dollars and employees were paid for a full day of holiday work without even working!!!! Please apple replace these managers and employees with people who can be prepared to protect your glorious products. These store employees really let us down.

My laptop was erased and some tests were done and the laptop returned to me a couple days later but the problem still exited. So the experience from the first visit wasn't great.The second time I went in Lucas really helped me out and fixed the issue in minutes!!

When I went to go pick up my phone after the repair. I was told the ‚ÄúApple employee repair department‚Äù broke my display screen. Apple took off my screen protector and couldn‚Äôt offer me any type of discount. Nor military discount. Manager passed me around employees . basically told me to ‚Äúf‚Äù myself."

11/15/2024,Lee Hinchcliffe,4,"Visited this store whilst on vacation, on the day of the new iPhone release, wanting to take advantage of a favourable exchange rate. As with all Apple stores well staffed (even bearing in mind how ridiculously busy it was) and staff all very friendly. Again, appreciate the sheer volume of people but arrived around noon, got to speak to someone very quickly, phone I wanted was in stock, but had to book a reservation appointment for 5 / 6 hours later??? Had to entertain myself in the area all that time which luckily was fine, but I do question if I was with someone, was in stock in store, why they just couldn‚Äôt grab and had to wait all that time??? No setup / tutorial was required and literally slipped the box in to my bag."

11/15/2024,Conor MacDonald,1,"Purchased brand new iPhone 15 ProMax in Feb 2024 from T-mobile‚Äôs Flagship downtown Seattle store.In June my phone started showing SOS mode.The frequency of SOS episodes only increased as the summer unfolded.By August I could no longer use my phone, text and calls do not work in SOS.I read multiple articles stating this has become an increasingly enormous problem for iPhones users and the carriers are all blaming Apple and Apple is blaming all the carriers. And the iPhone users remain with out service with no one owning the issue and resolving it for the masses.I went to T-mobile store who told me my IOS software was out of date and I had on VPN and problem solved.WRONG.They told me if there troubleshooting didn‚Äôt work then they wash their hands of it and it‚Äôs an Apple issue.As soon as I left this store, SOS came right back on.I brought the phone to Apple in University Village who required 2 ‚Äúgeniuses‚Äù to tell me I would need 80% of the hardware on the phone replaced and they referred to it as a ‚Äúsideboard‚Äù.I lost a good week from my phone which translated to $$$ as I‚Äôm a massage therapist and all my clients contact me via phone.Apple made me schedule a future appointment (48 hours later) as they didn‚Äôt even have the parts on site at their flagship store.Two days later I get my phone back from an Apple employee who throws the phone in my lap and said, it should start working in about 2 hours but if it doesn‚Äôt, ‚Äúbring the phone back to T-mobile and demand your ticket is escalated to the highest engineer within T mobile as it‚Äôs an issue with how they programmed your lines (I have two, personal and business). We are done at this point.‚ÄùI asked if they were going to help me get back online as it was essentially like getting a whole new phone. They said ‚Äúno, we are focusing on selling as many new products as possible and not handling defects and it‚Äôs not our issues it‚Äôs T-mobile‚Äôs. Please leave the store now.‚ÄùI walked the phone over to the University Village T-mobile to ask them to get me back up and running. Which they did and informed me I wasn‚Äôt getting full service and should bring the phone back to this store.I brought the phone once again back to the T Mobile store and the manager on duty that day gave me a huge attitude and kept telling me ‚Äúif you would just allowed to talk now! We aren‚Äôt going to replace your phone. That‚Äôs your issue.‚Äù I asked for a refund for service totaling one pay period as this went on for 3 months. They laughed at me and said; ‚Äúwe‚Äôll give you a $40 credit max, now leave.‚ÄùNever received the credit on my account.Funny how late stage capitalism works, we the customers would be cut off from service instantly if we don‚Äôt pay our bills. The provider?They tell us to leave their store. Apple is focused on selling as many of those stupid head set pieces and Mac books while T mobile is more focused on up selling stupid accessories in addition to new mobile devices.Absolute GARBAGE on both T-Mobile and Apple."

10/15/2024,Eric Griswold,1,"My experience at the Seattle Apple Store regarding a faulty AirPod was both disappointing and frustrating. Despite my expectations for a product's reasonable longevity and performance, the encounter left me with a sense of dissatisfaction and a decision to no longer purchase Apple's audio products.The issue began when one of my wifes AirPods ceased to function properly, despite being just under a year out of warranty. There was no apparent misuse or water damage‚Äîjust an inexplicable failure. I approached Dan, the manager, hoping for a solution or at least some acknowledgment of the issue. However, what followed was a disheartening display of indifference and defensiveness.Dan seemed unwilling to understand my perspective, immediately dismissing my concerns and accusing me of expecting preferential treatment when I stated that I have a history of purchasing other similar apple products. I simply wanted the product to work as expected, based on my previous positive experiences with Apple products lasting significantly longer. Instead of addressing the core issue of a product failure, Dan's focus was on discrediting my reasonable expectation that a premium product should perform reliably.His refusal to acknowledge the possibility of a product defect and his insinuation that my dissatisfaction stemmed from unreasonable demands left me feeling unheard and undervalued as a customer. Apple has built its reputation on quality and customer service, but this experience revealed a stark contrast to that image. The unwillingness to stand behind their product and the failure to empathize with a customer's reasonable expectation for reliability were disappointing and unexpected.My interaction with Dan and the Apple Store has solidified my decision to seek alternatives for audio products in the future. A company's commitment to quality and customer satisfaction should be paramount, yet my experience highlighted a significant gap in these values. I hope Apple reevaluates its approach to customer concerns and product support to maintain trust and loyalty among its customer base."

10/15/2024,Gary Crooks,1,"Just bought an IPhone 16 at this store. They don‚Äôt tell you upfront that you may not be able to charge your new phone in the car. I have a late model Toyota with Apple Car Play. The cord is different from the phone I traded in. So I had to drive back in traffic. Big hassle. I asked the worker why they don‚Äôt give customers a head‚Äôs up that they may need an adapter. She said, ‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt like it if I said that.‚ÄùIf true, not her fault. But it strikes me as unethical as policy. Why not save your customers a trip?"

10/15/2024,Patricia McCauley,5,"Abe is the GENIUS at this store!What a great store. Been awhile since I visited U Village Apple store and it has been totally remodeled.We had to travel 2 hours to the store and we had a difficult time making an appointment online so we just showed up hoping to get help at the genius bar.We were amazed at the 50 people waiting to get into the store when it opened. We thought they would all go to genius bar but instead went to sales. When we walked in, we were introduced to a sales person who we were told, if she can't fix our problem, she will connect us to someone at the genius bar. Our issue was an 30 year old email address that for some reason was trying to link our apple watch with all the other devices and prevented the link up.Our nice sales lady did the basics and got stuck so she brought Abe the head of the genius bar into help.and genius was a great term for him. We were in and out in half an hour with our problems resolved.Amazing Service from start to finish! Thank You so much!"

10/15/2024,Pr,5,"I do not do reviews but I came in today (9/21/24) and three people really helped me out with a complicated transaction. I contacted apple via text message but it wasn‚Äôt any help. Here‚Äôs my story: I went to preorder the new iPhone on the day the preorder came out but wanted to use my gift cards towards the balance and I planned on trading in my old phone once I got in store. But I wasn‚Äôt allowed to use gift cards with apple care on the preorder at the time of purchase because you cannot use gift cards while purchasing apple care which I later found out through apple text message. So I came into the store having to return the iPhone and rebuying it with the gift cards and trade in my old phone and 3 people really made my experience easy, comfortable and amazing. There were two men helping me during this confusing and time consuming ‚Äúproject‚Äù and the lady who broke it down to me on how we will get this done and I truly want to say THANK YOU ALL SOOOO MUCH I wish I got your names but you know who you are! This will be my home apple store for now on, I felt welcomed and appreciated which isn‚Äôt my first encounter with this same experience from the last time I came in to get my AirPod maxes fixed so thank you again I cannot thank you enough."

Then if you have a simple problem they send you to the CS # which is always a 30 min wait üòÄ I wasted 3 hours there for just two little small products like really oh and I also never got those products because the store was closing soon so I just spent time and gas for nothing. Also the place is unorganized you don‚Äôt even know where to go who to ask or anything you‚Äôre gonna have to spend time figuring it out yourself."

9/15/2024,Stu Young,1,"READ TILL THE END - Came in to Genius Bar with ‚ÄúSIM card error‚Äù and ‚Äúsos‚Äù for cell signal on my 13 Pro. Told that it couldn‚Äôt be fixed via reset, etc and needed to dis-assemble and re-assemble with a majority of new parts for $600. An hour later they showed up with a new 3 year old 13 Pro but said the SIM card was no good and I had to go to Verizon for a new SIM card. Huh??  I came in due to SIM card error. Smooth talking blonde haired, tall, S. Cal surfer dude manager showed up with every excuse in the book and sent me on my way to Verizon after collecting $600. Got to Verizon store only to be told the Apple Store completely mis-diagnosed the problem and that they‚Äôve had the same story many times‚Ä¶had the used car blonde surfer boy manager sent me to Verizon after I walked in with SIM card error I‚Äôd have saved $600!  Bottom line‚Ä¶Apple store is out to rip you off, they got me but I will get them back with many more reviews. Never trust a smooth talking blonde surfer boy dude that manages an Apple Store."

Had to wait 15 mins for someone to literally just get it off a shelf for me because they don't have a mechanism for a customer to just buy something and leave. Then it took 5 or 8 more minutes to actually pay for the stuff once it showed up.If you can buy a used product, definitely do that. New isn't much better and you'll likely have less hassle."

Free parking in a large parking lot. Many wheel chair spaces and a wheel chair accessible entrance! (Ramp and wide doors!)  They have so many different things to  pick from that it is hard to leave with only what you came in for! Everything that they carry is on display, as are a few items they don't have on hand (but they will get it ordered for you asap if they can't find a store nearby thay has what you are looking for). All of the employees are super nice and always happy to help. There is a ton of seating inside and outside, tables as well in some areas. They always have really neat classes you can join for free. Just go online and sign up. It is incredibly kid friendly, and there are areas for your little ones to stay busy, like tablets to play on and such. Outside, they have an area for kids and/or your dogs to play on as well! It's a very cushioned astroturff material, very safe for your littles! This is truly my #1 choice over any apple store I've been to, and I have been to many! Highly recommend!"

I pointed it out to the person helping me, and he couldn‚Äôt answer and stated that was what his device said after scanning my phone.I then took my phone home and used Apple‚Äôs website to print a Fedex label and received the full trade in value when it was received. I would say avoid going to the store in person whenever possible."

It took quite some time for the staff to make sure I was the right person when picking up the phone. They asked me to show a government-issued ID and called today an ""exception"" just for me because of the unmatched names, even though I had no idea why all this happened. Starting from service appointment, the buyer's (or registration) name neither appeared nor required, then for some reason it popped up on the final receipt. Go fix this service procedure Apple!"
